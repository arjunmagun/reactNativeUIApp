So this is my first React Native Expo app.
I created this app to learn react native. Well this is a personal app.
This is just a UI of social media app, kind of Instagram Clone.

I used expo to create the app, ImagePicker for picking the images and expo-camera for accessing camera to click photos.

Pull this app and check it out by running:
 ~ expo start
OR
 ~ npm start
